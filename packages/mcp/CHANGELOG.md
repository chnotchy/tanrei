### Minor Changes

- b0e55fb: The edge of a region that stays in place is drawn at rest. The app bar's bottom edge, the dividers below a dialog's
  or a popover's header and above its actions, and the divider below a side sheet's header came and went with the
  scroll position; each parts a fixed region from content that scrolls, so an app shell's header, for one, showed its
  line only once the page had moved. In the default system the app bar now draws its edge in both conditions, a dialog
  and a popover draw both dividers for as long as their content scrolls (at its top included; none while everything
  fits), and a side sheet draws the divider below its header whenever the header is drawn, as it already drew the one
  above its actions.
  
  A new choice of kind, `sys.behavior.divider-visibility` (`always` | `scroll`), read through
  `comp.app-bar.outline.visibility` and `comp.{dialog,popover,side-sheet}.divider.visibility`, and a
  `dividerVisibility` prop (`auto` | `always` | `scroll`, the `divider-visibility` attribute on the web) on the four
  components: `scroll` draws what they drew before. `cupertino` and `m3-like` choose `scroll`, as Apple's bars and
  Material's top app bar and dialogs do, so nothing changes under those presets. Lines that say there is more to scroll
  to — a table's sides and sticky header, a tree's or a drawer's pinned rows — are not this choice and still follow the
  scroll.
  
  The vocabulary gains these five tokens. The web draws the choice; SwiftUI, Compose, Flutter and React Native receive
  the tokens and the typed enumeration but do not draw the choice yet, and keep the scroll form. Baselines: the default
  system's app bar fixtures now show the bottom edge at rest, the dialog's and the popover's `scrolling` fixtures both
  dividers, and the side sheet's fixtures with a header the divider below it — the intended result of this change.

### Patch Changes

- 6016e87: Radio button: the center of a chosen radio now stands 3:1 apart from the ring around it (WCAG 1.4.11). In the default
  system the fill inside the thick ring is the ring's color at 16 % opacity rather than 50 %
  (`comp.radio-button.fill.opacity`, 0.5 → 0.16): a lighter tint, at least 3.17:1 from the ring at rest, hovered, focused
  and pressed, on every surface role and in all six schemes, where 50 % fell to 1.91:1 (the focused error form on
  `surface-container-highest` in light) and under 3:1 in the dark schemes once a state layer was under it. 16 % is the
  step the default system already uses for a selection's tint (a checked menu row, a selected list option, the tonal tabs'
  indicator). A menu's radio item draws the same ring, and its fill follows (`comp.menu.control.fill.opacity`,
  0.5 → 0.16; 4.67:1 at the least on the menu's sheet). The ring, its stroke and the motion are unchanged, and so are the
  imitation presets, whose radios have opaque centers of their own and whose menus mark radio items with a check.
  
  The token build holds it from now on: in every scheme, the fill of a radio's mark as drawn — at its opacity, over the
  state layer of each enabled state — is held 3:1 against the ring it meets, or, where `fill.inset` leaves a gap (a dot),
  against the gap, on every surface role (the menu's sheet for a menu's radio item). It fails the default system's build,
  is a warning for a product layer, and is recorded as information for an imitation preset (`cupertino`'s light center in
  a hairline ring is 1.80:1 in light). A product layer that strengthens the state layers may need a quieter fill: `tanrei
  validate` and the MCP server's `validate_layer` now say so. A finding about a pair of component colors is classed as a
  contrast measurement, as a pair of roles is.

## 0.1.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- f181fc2: Initial release. Tanrei is one design system shipped to five platforms — Web Components (with React wrappers), SwiftUI,
  Jetpack Compose, Flutter and React Native — from one set of DTCG design tokens and platform-neutral component specs.
  This release includes the token pipeline and its generated outputs for every platform, the default `tanrei` system and
  the shipped presets, the components listed in the [status matrix](https://tanrei.chnotchy.com/status/) at the status shown there
  for each platform, the token engine, the CLI, and the MCP server.
  
  Every published package carries its LICENSE and NOTICE, and what a build bundles (Lit in `@tanrei/web`'s
  `dist/tanrei.bundle.js`; the code and fonts of the Theme Studio app in `@tanrei/cli`) ships with its licences in
  `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
